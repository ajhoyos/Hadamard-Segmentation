## Introduction 
This work introduces the Hadamard Layer, a parameters training free that 
improves the accuracy of segmentation tasks by using a novel class encoding. 
This repository has a training example of our work using the Pix2Pix architecture 
with some variants and the CelebA-Mask-HQ dataset. 

In the future, we will add more models and details of our implementation.
